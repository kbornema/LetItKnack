Description:

In Schlossknacker you try to unlock locks as fast as possible by aligning and locking pins with a picklock. 
You have control on how fast to move the picklock to precisely push the pins as needed.
Later levels feature different pins and pin combinations.

Schlossknacker was developed during the February Monthly Game Challenge by Acagamics e.V. by Kai Bornemann.
